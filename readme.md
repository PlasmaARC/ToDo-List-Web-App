# JavaScript Projects
This is a task I set for myself to become proficient in Javascript. I'll be working on ten JavaScript projects that will help me become proficient in the language (I'm claiming this on my own). There is still plenty to do.

I've studied all of the language's foundational concepts as well as some of the most well-liked JavaScript frameworks and modules. I am still learning, but I am familiar with React.js, Next.js, and Angular.js. I'm only going to create projects on all of these subjects from now on.
